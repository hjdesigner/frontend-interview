### About project development

Analyzing what needed to be done in the project, I chose to use only HTML, CSS and Javascript because there would be few interactions in a single page, I didn't think I needed to add libs and frameworks and increase the complexity of the code and how to run the project.


#### Improvements I would make to the project if I had more time

- Improve the nomenclature of the 4 in a row game;
- Make the reset function more generous because today it resets both games at the same time;
- Make the method of publishing statistics simpler and instead of duplicating, create a generic method that changes by parameter;
